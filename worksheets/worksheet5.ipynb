    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worksheet we learn how to read and write files. We will also learn more string manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites (...need to open a terminal...):\n",
    "- filesystem (the commands `cd`, `ls`, `pwd` in terminal)\n",
    "- relative versus absolute paths\n",
    "- special repositories `./` and `../`\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function to deal with files is the function `open`. When using it you have to specify a mode that can be `'w'`Â for writing or `'r'` for reading. **When you open a file in writing mode you erase its content!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a creation of a file in the repository `/tmp/` (that is intended to be used for temporary files)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"w\")      # open in write mode\n",
    "f.write(\"I am writing to a file\\n\")  # write a string in the file\n",
    "f.write(\"it is cool!\\n\")             # write a string in the file\n",
    "f.close()                            # closing the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is important to close the file (the last step above) since otherwise some data might not have been written in the file (because of buffers). If you have a file on the disc then you can read its content with\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# opening file in read mode\n",
    "g = open(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"r\")   # open in read mode\n",
    "text = g.read()                   # gettint content as a string\n",
    "g.close()                         # closing the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "- execute the first set of commands above that creates the file `/tmp/hello.txt`\n",
    "- check with nautilus or the terminal that this file does exist on your computer (you can even open it and edit it with gedit)\n",
    "- execute the second set of commands above that reads the content of this file `/tmp/hello.txt`\n",
